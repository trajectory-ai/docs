# Get Started

[trajectory](https://trajectoryevals.com) is a SDK that helps you with everything post-building. You can use it to trace, 
capture user metrics, create custom monitors and run evaluations on your agents. 
We are working on getting the feature of dataset creation very very soon. 


trajectory is built and maintained by [trajectory.ai](https://trajectoryevals.com).

## Get your free trajectory API keys

Head to the [trajectory](https://trajectoryevals.com/dashboard) and create an account.
 Then, copy your API key into your environment variables. 

```bash
export TRAJECTORY_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

    ## Start tracing with trajectory

    Below is a minimal example that instruments a small function and an LLM call. You’ll see both the function and the tool step show up as spans in your trace.

    ```py title="trace.py"
    from trajectory import Tracer, wrap
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Wrap your OpenAI client so model calls are captured as spans
    client = wrap(OpenAI())

    # Initialize a tracer to group spans into a single trace
    tracer = Tracer(project_name="default_project")

    # Mark helper utilities as tools
    @tracer.observe(span_type="tool")
    def format_currency(n: float) -> str:
        return f"${n:,.2f}"

    # Your application logic — captured as a function span
    @tracer.observe(name="plan_trip", span_type="function")
    def plan_trip(city: str) -> str:
        prompt = f"Plan a 1-day itinerary for {city}. Budget: {format_currency(120)}."
        resp = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        )
        return resp.choices[0].message.content

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        plan_trip("Lisbon")
    ```

    Congratulations! You've just created your first trace.
